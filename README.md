UNDERGRADUATE COURSE OUTLINE
COURSE CODE: ARC181H1S   L0101
COURSE TITLE: Technologies of Architecture,   Landscape,   Urbanism and Art I
COURSE   DESCRIPTION:...ideas are not stockpiled in heaven   to be contemplated by   philosophy...new ideas are constantly appearing in   the heat   of theory’s battle against a raw, resistant world.—Vilém   Flusser
...a city is hardware,   in all senses.   —Reinhold Martin
This course   is   intended to   introduce   undergraduate students to the   history and theory of technics   as   it   relates to all design disciplines.    It   is thematically organized;   rather than   pursue   a   progressive   and
historicist   narrative of the development of ever-more sophisticated technologies and then   chart those   in   the progression of architectural “styles,” the course will follow   a   method that   describes   all   cultural
artifacts—including, especially, architecture, landscape,   urbanism, and art—as   in   and   of   themselves
technical.    They are the product of highly   articulated   techniques;   they   are   always   not   simply things   but      also   media; and, lastly, their continued significance depends   entirely   upon their   repeated   re-mediation.
The course   is organized into four sections, each   of   which   identify   certain technical functions
characteristic of design techniques: (re)producing   (which includes   planning,   mapping, writing,   copying,      and   mass   producing);   lifting   (which   includes   building, ornamenting,   mining, and   harvesting), depicting      (which   includes all   manner of   representational techniques), and   moving   (which   includes   infrastructures,   corporate formations, and machinery for reducing what economists   call   “transaction   costs”).
Throughout the course, the central focus of the course will be   on   beginning   to   understand   the
basic, constitutive elements of knowledge that constitute architecture;   however, whenever   appropriate,
lectures and discussion sections will treat highly significant   artifacts from the   history   of   landscape,
urbanism, art, and various   industrial   and   infrastructural products that are   not   usually   classed with the first   four categories.
Course Objectives
By the conclusion of the course, students will   have a broad   familiarity   with the   main   lines   of   technical   development   in the   history of architecture, landscape,   urbanism, and art,   including   the   economic,
philosophical   and aesthetic concepts underpinning those developments.    They will   also possess
rudimentary   knowledge of technical   and architectural   historiography,   be able to   maintain a   rigorously
organized annotated bibliography of the assigned   readings,   and   be capable   of   producing   a   clear   précis   of   a complex text.
Assignments and Important   Dates
In addition to completing all of the assigned   readings for   the   course,   attending   lectures   and   discussion   sections, there are two main assignments for   the course:   1.   an annotated   bibliography   of   all assigned   required readings (noted   in the schedule of classes below and   marked with   an   asterisk);   and   2.   two   précis   on any of two assigned or   recommended   readings   listed   in the schedule   of   classes   below.      More   precise   instructions on these assignments will   be given   in class, and guidelines   for   how to   complete   both   assignments will   be   issued   in the second week of class.
There will   also be a midterm exam,   administered during tutorial,   which will   be   composed   of   multiple   choice questions   based   upon the content of lectures   and   readings.
Attendance will   be   kept   by the teaching assistants.    Each student   must sign   in   at   each   lecture   and discussion section after the   first lecture   (i.e. attendance will   be kept from Weeks   2 through   12).      Any   more than two   unexcused absences will   result in a failing   grade   in the   course.      An   excused   absence   is given only   if the student   notifies   his or her assigned teaching   assistant   in   advance   of the   course   session   to be   missed, or   if the student   presents written evidence for   her/his absence   (e.g.   from   a   medical   professional, academic   advisor, etc.).
A   list of all sessional dates can be found   at:   https://daniels.calendar.utoronto.ca/sessional-dates
For any and all discrepancies   between the schedule of   classes   below   and the   dates   listed   on the   website,   please consider the website to be correct.
General   Note on   Evaluation
Evaluation will   be carried out   in accordance with the   University Assessment and Grading   Practices   Policy.   Please   refer to the policy located on the governing council website:
http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Governing_Council/policies.htm#G
Evaluation
In addition to basic   participation   in the course (i.e.,   completing the   assigned   readings,   attending   class
meetings, and contributing to class discussions), there are two primary   assignments   for the   course,   each   of which   is described   in greater detail   in an appendix   to this   course   outline.
Fulfillment of the basic   participation   requirement counts for 25% of   each   student’s   grade   in   the   course.
The first assignment   is an annotated bibliography, which is   an organized   bibliography   accompanied      by specific   notes on the   text.    This should be   maintained throughout the   course   of   the   semester,   and   will   be evaluated on the following basis:   1.   Does the annotated bibliography   conform   to the   bibliographic
standards   laid out in   The Chicago Manual of Style. (15th    or   16th    ed.)? 2.   Does the annotated   bibliography   contain   notes for each required   reading   in the schedule of classes?      No   qualitative   assessment   of   the
notes will figure   in the assessment of the grade.    The   annotated   bibliography counts   for   25%   of   each   student’s grade   in the course.
The second assignment is to produce,   by the   end   of   the term,   two   separate   précis   of two   separate   texts from the   required or   recommended   reading for the course.    The length of the   précis   depends   somewhat   upon the overall   length of the text being summarized,   but   as a   rule the   précis   should   be   no   longer than three pages, double-spaced,   12 pt. font.    Specific   guidelines   on   précis writing   will   be distributed   in the second week of the class, and   both the professor   and   the teaching   assistants will   also   devote class time to discussing   how best to write an effective   précis.    The two   précis   count for   25%   of each student’s grade   in the course.
The   midterm exam counts for 25% of each student’s grade   in   the   course.
Late WorkAll   assignments are due   in class or submitted via e-mail   at the specified time   and date.      Late   submission   will   result   in a   10% deduction of each assignment’s total   grade   per   business day   (excluding   weekends).      In the case of   illness or other special circumstance,   notification should   be   given   to the   professor   and   the
Registrar as soon as   possible and before the   deadline   in   question;   where   required,   the   official   University   of Toronto Verification of Student   Illness or   Injury form. should be   submitted.
Final   Due   Date
Students are   not permitted to submit work   past the 12 April 2018   deadline   unless they   have formally   (i.e.   in writing)   requested and   received special   permission from the   Daniels   Faculty administration to do so.
There   is   no guarantee that the professor will approve such   a   request,   but   every   provision   will   be   granted   under the appropriate circumstances.
Preparedness at   UofT
Students are advised to consult the   University’s   preparedness site   (http://www.preparedness.utoronto.ca)   for   information and   regular updates   regarding procedures for emergency   planning.

Advice on Writing: Academic Writing
Reading and   Using Sources:   How   Not to   Plagiarize
The   University of Toronto’s Code of   Behavior. on Academic   Matters   states that:   “It shall   be an offence for a   student   knowingly:
…
(d) to   represent as one’s own any   idea or   expression   of   an   idea   or work   of   another   in   any   academic   examination or term test or   in connection with any other form   of   academic   work,   i.e, to   commit
plagiarism.”
The Code also states: “Wherever   in the Code   an   offence   is   described   as   depending   on ‘knowing,’ the offence shall   likewise be   deemed to have been   committed   if   the   person   ought   reasonably   to   have   known.”
